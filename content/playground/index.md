# Welcome to the Snippex Playground! ðŸš€

This repository serves as a creative space for developers to experiment, work on proofs of concept (PoCs), and test features that are in progress. It's a playground for exploring new ideas and
technologies.

## Purpose

The Playground serves the following purposes:

1. **Experimentation:** Test out new technologies, libraries, or concepts in a controlled environment.
2. **Prototyping:** Work on proof of concepts for potential features or improvements.
3. **Integration Testing:** Test the integration of different experiments in the root-level `playground`{lang="bash"} folder.

## Structure

- The `content/playground`{lang="bash"} folder contains specific experiments, proofs of concept, and ongoing development work. Mainly, for documenting and testing new ideas.
- The root-level `playground`{lang="bash"} folder is used for integrating and testing different experiments. It may also contain shared utilities or components.

## How to Use

1. **Explore Existing Projects:** Check out the contents of the `content/playground`{lang="bash"} folder to discover ongoing experiments.
2. **Create Your Experiment:** If you have a new idea or PoC, create a dedicated folder within `content/playground`{lang="bash"} and also in `playground`{lang="bash"} for integration testing.
   Ensure that the folder name is
   descriptive and easy to understand.
3. **Create a New Branch:** Before you start working on your experiment or feature, it's recommended to create a new branch specifically for the playground. You can use the following commands in your
   terminal:

    ```bash
    # Replace {feature-or-poc-name} with your actual feature or PoC name
    git checkout -b experimental/{feature-or-poc-name}-{poc|playground}
       ```

    Example:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b experimental/new-feature-poc
   ```

4. **Integration Testing:** Integrate and test your experiments in the root-level `playground`{lang="bash"} folder.

## Documentation

Each experiment or PoC within `content/playground`{lang="bash"} should have its own README providing details on how to use, test, and contribute.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Collaborate and seek feedback from the team.
- Ensure your work aligns with the project's overall goals.
- Document your experiments well for easy understanding by others.

## Important Note

The Playground is a dynamic space for exploration, and projects here might be incomplete or subject to change. It's an excellent place for innovation and learning.

### Transition to Main Project

When the features or experiments in the Playground are ready for release or integration into the main project, follow these steps:

1. **Create a New Branch:** Start a new branch for the feature or experiment that is ready for integration.
2. **Implement Proper Documentation:** Provide comprehensive documentation for the feature, including usage instructions, code structure, and any relevant details.
3. **Follow Coding Standards:** Ensure that the code adheres to the project's coding standards and best practices.
4. **Testing:** Conduct thorough testing to identify and fix any issues before merging into the main branch.
5. **Create Pull Request:** Submit a pull request for review and feedback from the team.
6. **Milestone Tracking:** If applicable, assign the pull request to a specific milestone to keep track of project progress.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
